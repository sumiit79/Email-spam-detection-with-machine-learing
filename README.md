TASK 1 - EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
Introduction:
We've all experienced receiving spam emails, which can be annoying, time-consuming, and potentially dangerous. This project aims to address this issue by building an email spam detector using Python. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can train the spam detector to accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam.

Features
Utilizes Python for building the email spam detector. Applies machine learning algorithms for training and classification. Implements label encoding to transform categorical data. Uses Logistic Regression for the classification task. Allows for custom prediction inputs.

Installation
To run the email spam detector, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
Python 3.x
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
